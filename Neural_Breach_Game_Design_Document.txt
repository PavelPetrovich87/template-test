# Neural Breach: Game Design Document

**Project Name:** Neural Breach  
**Tagline:** *Train your working memory by hacking corporate firewalls.*  
**Platform:** Web (React/Vue), Mobile-ready (responsive CSS)  
**Target Audience:** Cognitive training enthusiasts, productivity-focused users, competitive learners  
**Genre:** Educational Cognitive Training + Idle RPG  

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Neural Breach wraps the scientifically-proven **Dual N-Back** working memory training task inside a cyberpunk hacking narrative. Users are "hackers" attempting to breach firewalls by maintaining focus on a dual-stream memory task while managing a "Connection Stability" resource. The core training mechanic is preserved (two concurrent stimulus streams, adaptive difficulty, immediate feedback), but wrapped in a **Terminal UI** with simple progression systems (Data Shards, Hardware Upgrades, Themes) that reward consistent play without adding cognitive load during training.

**Key Design Philosophy:** The game should feel rewarding, not punitive. Every correct answer is a tiny victory. Every mistake costs you something (Stability, Data Shards), but doesn't break the training flow or data collection.

---

## 2. Core Gameplay Loop

### 2.1 The Training Session ("Breach Attempt")

**Duration:** 3–5 minutes per session (customizable)  
**Structure:** One session consists of multiple *blocks*, each block = 20 trials (1 trial = 1 stimulus pair)

#### The N-Back Task (Unchanged)
- **Visual Stream:** A 3×3 grid. One cell lights up every 2–3 seconds.
- **Audio Stream:** A letter (A–Z) plays every 2–3 seconds.
- **Player Input:** Two buttons (or keyboard keys).
  - Button 1: "Match Audio" (press if the current letter matches the letter from *n* steps back).
  - Button 2: "Match Position" (press if the current grid cell matches the cell from *n* steps back).
- **Difficulty:** Starts at n=2. Adapts:
  - **Accuracy ≥ 80%:** Increase to n+1.
  - **Accuracy ≤ 60%:** Decrease to n−1.
  - Adapts once per block.

#### New Layer: Connection Stability

**What it is:** A health bar representing your "hacker's connection to the target."

**Mechanics:**
- **Starting Value:** 100% per block.
- **Correct Match:** Stability holds (no change). Player earns +1 Data Shard.
- **Correct Non-Match (Correctly NOT pressing):** Stability holds. Player earns +1 Data Shard.
- **False Alarm (Pressing when no match):** Stability drops by 15%. Player earns 0 Shards. *Visual Feedback:* Screen border flashes red (0.3s CSS animation).
- **Miss (Not pressing when there IS a match):** Stability drops by 10%. Player earns 0 Shards. *Visual Feedback:* Screen border flashes yellow (0.3s CSS animation).
- **Zero Stability Reached:** Block continues (data is still collected for research), but UI enters "Safe Mode":
  - Screen desaturates (opacity: 0.6, grayscale: 50%).
  - No more Data Shards earned for the rest of the block.
  - Stability bar shows a warning badge: "⚠ Connection Lost."

**Why:** Stability adds emotional stakes without changing the training. Users feel they are "protecting a resource" rather than just answering questions.

### 2.2 Block End Screen

After 20 trials, the session pauses and shows:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         BLOCK COMPLETED             │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Accuracy:        85%                │
│ Data Shards:     17 / 20             │
│ Current N-Level: 3                  │
│ Connection:      ✓ Stable           │
│ Next Block:      n=4                │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│         [CONTINUE] [QUIT]           │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Options:**
- **CONTINUE:** Start the next block at the new n-level.
- **QUIT:** End the session, show final summary, deposit all earned Shards into the account.

### 2.3 Session End Screen

After the user quits or completes the target block count:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│       BREACH SESSION COMPLETE       │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Total Blocks:        5              │
│ Total Shards:        82             │
│ Avg Accuracy:        78%            │
│ Peak N-Level:        4              │
│ Session Time:        14 min 32 sec  │
│ Streak Bonus:        +5 Shards      │

## 3. Resource Economy

### 3.1 Data Shards (Primary Currency)

**What it represents:** Stolen data = reward for successfully maintaining focus.

**Earning Rules:**
- **Base Rate:** 1 Shard per correct trial.
- **Streak Bonus:** 5 consecutive correct trials → Next correct match = 2 Shards.
- **Session Bonus:** Complete all blocks without losing Stability to zero → +5 bonus Shards.
- **Daily Bonus:** If you train 3+ days in a row → Session rewards × 1.2 multiplier.

**Spending:**
- Buy Hardware upgrades (see Section 4).
- Buy cosmetic themes.
- *Future expansion:* Trade for leaderboard entries or seasonal badges.

**Display:** Top-right corner of the main UI. Icon: `💾` next to a number. Persistent across sessions.

## 7. Data & Analytics

### 7.1 What We Track (For Research)

The app logs every trial with:
- Timestamp
- Stimulus (grid position + audio letter)
- N-level at trial
- User response (match / non-match)
- Accuracy (correct / incorrect / false alarm / miss)
- Reaction time (ms)
- Stability at trial start

**Reporting:** Users can view:
- **Session History:** A table of all past sessions (date, duration, peak n-level, avg accuracy).
- **Progress Graph:** Working memory growth over time (x-axis: days, y-axis: peak n-level reached).
- **Personal Best:** "Highest n-level reached: 5" or "Best accuracy: 94%."

### 7.2 Leaderboard (Optional, Social)

**Leaderboard Types:**
- **Weekly Peak N-Level:** Who reached the highest n-level this week?
- **Accuracy Champions:** Who maintained >90% accuracy?
- **Consistency Kings:** Who trained the most days in a row?

**Anonymous by default.** Users can opt-in to show their username.

## 8. Technical Architecture (Developer Notes)

### 8.1 Core State Management

```javascript
// Pseudo-code structure
const sessionState = {
  currentNLevel: 2,
  currentBlock: 0,
  totalBlocks: 5,
  stability: 100,
  dataShardsEarned: 0,
  streakCorrect: 0,
  trials: [
    { timestamp, stimulus, response, isCorrect, reactionTime },
    // ...
  ],
};

const userState = {
  totalShards: 485,
  ownedUpgrades: ['buffer_expansion', 'overclock_cpu'],
  currentTheme: 'amber_retro',
  sessionHistory: [...],
};
```

### 8.2 Key Subsystems

| Subsystem | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Stimulus Generator** | Create random grid + audio sequences respecting n-back rules. |
| **Difficulty Adapter** | Adjust n-level based on accuracy after each block. |
| **Input Handler** | Capture button presses, validate timing, store reaction time. |
| **Feedback Engine** | Update Stability, increment Shard count, queue animations (border flash). |
| **Persistence Layer** | Save session data to backend (or localStorage for MVP). |
| **Shop Engine** | Validate purchases, apply upgrade effects to user state. |
| **Analytics Dashboard** | Compute stats (accuracy %, peak n, trends) for display. |

### 8.3 Frontend Stack Suggestion

Given your React/Vue expertise:
- **Framework:** React (Hooks for state) or Vue 3 (Composition API).
- **Styling:** CSS-in-JS (Styled Components) or Tailwind for rapid theming.
- **State Management:** Zustand or Pinia (lightweight, fast).
- **Storage:** IndexedDB for offline-first session caching; sync to backend on network.
- **Animations:** CSS keyframes only (no GPU-heavy JS animations during trials).

### 8.4 Backend (Optional for MVP)

**Minimal Backend:**
- User authentication (Firebase Auth or similar).
- Session data storage (Firestore or PostgreSQL).
- Leaderboard aggregation.

**For MVP:** Could be entirely client-side (localStorage + export-to-JSON for backup).

---

## 9. Monetization Strategy

### 9.1 Ad Placement

**Non-Intrusive Locations:**
- **Banner Ads:** Bottom of the main menu (below "Balance: 485 Shards").
- **Interstitial Ads:** *Optional:* After session completion, before showing the end screen (skip option available).
- **Rewarded Ads:** Optional. Users can watch a 15–30s ad to earn +50 bonus Shards (once per day).

**Ad-Free Tier (Paid Optional):**
- One-time $4.99 purchase removes all ads.
- Does not affect training or upgrades.

### 9.2 Cosmetics (In-App Purchase)

Premium themes (Vaporwave, Cyberpunk Neon) could be purchasable with real money ($0.99 each) *or* Shards. This creates a "Shard sink" for engaged players while offering a shortcut to impatient spenders.

---

## 10. Engagement Loops

### 10.1 Daily Loop (5–15 minutes)

1. User opens app.
2. Sees "3-day streak 🔥" banner (social proof).
3. Clicks "START BREACH."
4. Completes 5 blocks (~12 minutes).
5. Earns 80 Shards (net).
6. Views session end screen, feels accomplished.
7. Notices "Only 120 Shards to Dual-Core Processor!" Motivation to return tomorrow.

### 10.2 Weekly Loop

1. User accumulates 300+ Shards.
2. Unlocks a new upgrade from the shop.
3. Uses it in next session, feels a tangible improvement (e.g., "Stability damage reduced!").
4. Posts session screenshot to social (achievement sharing).

### 10.3 Monthly Loop

1. User reviews progress graph. "I went from n=2 to n=4 in 2 weeks!"
2. Competes on leaderboard for "Peak N-Level."
3. Aims to reach n=5 to beat their record.

---

## 13. Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- |
| Users quit due to difficulty spikes. | Stability bar acts as a "safety net." Failsafe Protocol upgrade available. Tutorial session explains difficulty adaptation. |
| Ad fatigue reduces retention. | Ads only on menu, optional rewarded, skip-friendly. Premium tier removes ads. |
| N-back is inherently "boring." | Terminal UI + resource economy provides extrinsic motivation. |
| Data privacy concerns. | Clear privacy policy. Data tied to anonymous session IDs by default. Opt-in for leaderboard. |
| Server costs scale poorly. | MVP is client-side first. Minimal backend for auth + leaderboards. |

## Design Notes for Development

1. **Preserve the Science:** Every change to UI/UX must be validated against the core n-back principles. When in doubt, ask: "Does this distract the user from the dual streams?"

2. **Minimize Animation:** CSS-only animations on non-critical elements (borders, text color). No GPU-heavy transforms during trials.

3. **Mobile-First CSS:** The grid and buttons must be touchable and not cramped on a 5-inch phone.

4. **Accessibility:** High contrast (WCAG AA). All interactive elements keyboard-accessible. Screen reader friendly.

5. **Performance:** Session logic should run at 60 FPS. Stimulus timing must be precise (±50ms tolerance). Use `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth renders.

6. **Data Export:** Users should be able to export their session history as CSV for personal records or research collaboration.
